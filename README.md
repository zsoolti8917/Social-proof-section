### What I learned

I completed this project a week ago; however, I did not include any comments or adhere to best practices at the time. Since then, I have gained a significant amount of experience and improved my skills. Despite the initial oversights, I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project. To accurately position the elements, I extensively utilized the transform feature, which resulted in satisfactory outcomes. Furthermore, I incorporated an interactive star rating system that can be altered by modifying the style attribute using "--rating: 5." I must acknowledge that the code I used was not my own; I found it online and regretfully cannot recall the original author's name. Nevertheless, I diligently reviewed and refactored the code multiple times to gain a thorough understanding of its operations.

### Continued development

I do not intend to make any further additions to this project as I believe it is complete, and I am satisfied with the outcome. I am committed to advancing my skills and knowledge by embarking on new projects and honing my abilities.
